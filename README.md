Bugs found and fixed
There were a number of bugs (or issues) that I found very frustrating. Pretty sure the vast majority were down to my inexperience, forgetting to send code to git, and then losing it all.

One that totally baffled me in the CodeAnywhere IDE was the constant issues with CCS Code not responding as I’d expected. Even after setting up another CSS Folder to feed from, it still did not resolve.

Bugs found and NOT fixed
It is now 22.00 Hrs so just 2 Hrs to Complete & Present.

Even though it did not happen on my Tablet,

I note image shows left justification

I’ll need have a look again at this
