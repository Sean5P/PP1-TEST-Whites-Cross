### Strategy for "Whites Cross" Website

The "Whites Cross" website was built to celebrate and preserve the rich heritage, and significance of Whites Cross. Our main strategy revolves around establishing the web-site as the primary hub for locals and visitors alike, serving as their first port of call for any information, events, or activities related to Whites Cross and its neighbouring areas.

Going forward, the site will offer an all-encompassing guide that immerses visitors in the very essence of Whites Cross. It will bridge the past with the present, as it moves from being a County Area to a City Suburb, ensuring the continuation and appre-ciation of Whites Cross's storied legacy.

### Bugs found and fixed
There were a number of bugs (or issues) that I found very frustrating. Pretty sure the vast majority were down to my inexperience, forgetting to send code to git, and then losing it all.

One that totally baffled me in the CodeAnywhere IDE was the constant issues with CCS Code not responding as I’d expected. Even after setting up another CSS Folder to feed from, it still did not resolve (& An old Blank CSS.

Bugs found and NOT fixed
It is now 22.00 Hrs so just 2 Hrs to Complete & Present.

Even though it did not happen on my Tablet,
I note image shows left justification. I’ll need to have a look at this again.
